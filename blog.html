            <h3>Difference Between Local Storage and Session Storage</h3>
            <p>
                The read-only sessionStorage property accesses a session Storage object for the current origin. sessionStorage is similar to localStorage; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab. That page session is valid only for that particular tab.A page session lasts as long as the tab or the browser is open, and survives over page reloads and restores.
